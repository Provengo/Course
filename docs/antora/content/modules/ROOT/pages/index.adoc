Provengo is a tool for organizations that develop software systems. It improves communication between business, development, and QA teams, and improved product quality. This is done by making system requirements active - they can be validated, visualized, and imposed on the developed system using auto-generated, optimized test suites.

NOTE: This is a tutorials site for Provengo's commandline tool. For the documentation site, please visit https://docs.provengo.tech[provengo.tech].
