= Load Order

Model source files are loaded in the following order:

. Internal libraries, when summoned by `//@provengo summon`
. All `.js` files in the `lib` folder
. All `.js` files in the `data` folder
. Files in the `spec` folder:
.. `.bpmn` files in `spec/bpmn`
.. `.combi` files in `spec/combi`
.. `.js` files in `spec/js`
. When using commands other than `run`: All `.js` files in `meta-spec`

In each folder, files are loaded in alphabetic order.

TIP: In order to conveniently disable and enable source files (e.g. to switch between automation types), create a sub-directory in `spec/`, and disable and enable file by moving them in and out of it. A good name for it might be `spec/disabled`.
