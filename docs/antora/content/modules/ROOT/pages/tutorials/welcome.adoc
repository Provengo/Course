= Welcome to Provengo

Provengo is a tool designed for testers and other stakeholders in a software project. It allows you to describe the possible usage scenarios of the product in a compositional manner and translate this description into test plans with optimal coverage.

Provengo is based on the behavioral-programming modeling approach, which allows for a natural and incremental description of complex reactive systems. With Provengo, users can describe high-level scenarios, interleave them to get combined scenarios, and map them to detailed scenarios that go all the way to clicking buttons, selecting radio-boxes, and filling fields using the Selenium library.

== Key Features

* **Compositional Scenario Description**: Describe usage scenarios in a modular way.
* **Optimal Test Coverage**: Generate test plans that ensure comprehensive coverage.
* **Behavioral Programming**: Use a modeling approach that supports incremental and natural descriptions of complex systems.
* **Integration with Selenium**: Automate detailed interactions with web applications using Selenium.

== How It Works

1. **Describe High-Level Scenarios**: Define the main actions and events that can occur in the system.
2. **Interleave Scenarios**: Combine multiple high-level scenarios to explore different interactions and edge cases.
3. **Map to Detailed Scenarios**: Translate the combined scenarios into detailed test steps, including UI interactions with Selenium.
