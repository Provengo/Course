## Excercise
Open your terminal and navigate to a directory where you have write permissions. Execute the following command and respond to the prompts:
[source,console]
----
$ provengo create EX1
----

Executing the command will generate a directory named `EX1`, which contains a `hello_world.js` file located in the `spec/js` subdirectory. Clear the existing content of this file and replace it with the following code. If desired, you can also rename the file:

[source,js]
----
bthread("1", function () {
    sync({ request: Event("A") })
    sync({ request: Event("A") })
})

bthread("2", function () {
    sync({ request: Event("B") })
    sync({ request: Event("B") })
})

bthread("3", function () {
    sync({ request: Event("C") })
    sync({ request: Event("C") })
})
----

Your task is to introduce a fourth bthread that enforces the rule: if `A` is triggered, it cannot be triggered again until after `C` has been triggered. Once you incorporate your code,  executing

[source,console]
---- 
$ provengo analyze -f pdf EX1 
----

should generate a file named `EX1/products/run-source/testSpace.pdf`. This file should contain the following content:
