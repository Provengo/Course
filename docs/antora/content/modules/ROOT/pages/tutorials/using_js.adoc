====
Open your terminal and navigate to a directory where you have write permissions. Execute the following command and respond to the prompts:
[source,console]
----
$ provengo create EX-js
----

Executing the command will generate a directory named `EX-js`, which contains a `hello_world.js` file located in the `spec/js` subdirectory. Clear the existing content of this file and replace it with the following code. If desired, you can also rename the file:

[source,js]
----
bthread("1", function () {
    sync({ request: Event("A") })
    sync({ request: Event("A") })
})

bthread("2", function () {
    sync({ request: Event("B") })
    sync({ request: Event("B") })
})
----

Your task is to introduce a third bthread that enforces that the events `A`, `B`, `A` are not triggered in this sequel. Once you incorporate your code,  executing

[source,console]
---- 
$ provengo analyze -f pdf EX-js 
----

will generate a file named `EX-js/products/run-source/testSpace.pdf`. If you designed the fourth bthread correctly, this file should contain the following content: 

[.text-center] 
image::EX-js-expected.png[Expected Test Space, width=50%]    

If you get a different result, try to figure out what went wrong. If you get stuck, you can find the solution in the `EX-js/solution` directory.
