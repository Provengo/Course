In this short tutorial we`ll present you to our https://dummy-bank.provengo.tech/[Dummy-Bank website]. 
This is an example based on the real world, which simulates the process of scheduling an appointment at the bank. 

IMPORTANT: _Provengo Dummy Bank_ is not a real bank. It is a part of the _Provengo tutorials sites_ and is used to demonstrait a common use-case of the Provengo tool. 

// In order to build a good model for your SUT you should be familiar with it.

When completing this tutorial you'll know::
    - The basic behavior and main flow of the _Dummy Bank_ app. +
    - The different screens appearing based on different user inputs. +
    - How to begin testing the _Dummy-Bank_ app and further tutorials. +


This is useful because::
    It is a real-world example, showing some classic flow, screens and features that are very common in webapps. +
    Understanding the app flow is important to better understanding how to use the Provengo tool when later testing the _Dummy Bank_ by yourself, or when following other _Dummy Bank_ hands-on tutorials. +



## Main Flow:

In this section, we'll provide a comprehensive overview of the Provengo Dummy Bank App. +
The image below shows the main flow containing the different screens of the _Dummy-Bank_ app. 

// The login screen is The first screen of the _Dummy-Bank_ app. To Access the dashboard, the user needs to enter a valid username and password. 
// On the dashboard, the user should choose a service for his meeting, then a topic  find the choose a service panel
// Starting with the login screen, moving onto the dashboard screen where users can start the scheduling process. Choosing a service and a topic, and setting up the disired time and branch for the meeting. Then fill in the contact information and confirm the meeting details until finally receving the system confirmation.

// ## Modeling
// - Let's think of some different ways to create a test model for this website. 

// TIP: There's not one right way to model, you can use the {link-provengo-library}[Provengo library] that works best with how you think and with the system's needs. 

// A good practice is to first model the high level of the system and then dive deeper. 
// There are some common ways to describe systems; State machines, BPMN, Storylines and more.. 

// For example, You can describe the high level of the system with a state machines. 



// NOTE: After you have a model it will produce the test scenarios for you. So make sure the model includes all the relevant information for it. 


## What's Next?
