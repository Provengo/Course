In this short tutorial we`ll present you to our https://dummy-bank.provengo.tech/[Dummy-Bank website]. 
This is an example based on the real world, which simulates the process of scheduling an appointment at the bank. 

IMPORTANT: _Provengo Dummy Bank_ is not a real bank. It is a part of the _Provengo tutorials sites_ and is used to demonstrait a common use-case of the Provengo tool. 


When completing this tutorial you'll know::
    The basic behavior and main flow of the _Dummy Bank_ app. +
    The different screens appearing based on different user inputs. +
    How to begin testing the _Dummy-Bank_ app and further tutorials. +


This is useful because::
    It is a real-world example, showing some classic flow, screens and features that are very common in webapps. +
    Understanding the app flow is important to better understanding how to use the Provengo tool when later testing the _Dummy Bank_ by yourself, or when following other _Dummy Bank_ hands-on tutorials. +
