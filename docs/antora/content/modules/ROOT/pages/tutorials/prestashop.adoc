.Exercise: Installing PrestaShop
[%collapsible]
====
In this exercise, you will install PrestaShop on your local machine.

The easiest way to install PrestaShop is to use Docker. If you don't have Docker installed, you can download it from the official website: link:https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker Desktop].

Once you have docker installed, follow these steps to install PrestaShop:

1. Download the `prestashop.zip` file from link:{attachmentsdir}/prestashop.zip[here] and unzip it in a directory of your choice. On Ubuntu, you can use the `unzip` command to extract the zip file. For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
wget https://provengo.github.io/Course/Online%20Course/0.9.5/_attachments/prestashop.zip
unzip prestashop.zip 
----

2. Use `docker-compose up -d` in this directory to start a new container with the PrestaShop image. On Ubuntu, navigate to the directory where you unzipped the PrestaShop files and run the command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd prestashop
docker-compose up -d
----

3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to access the PrestaShop installation page:
